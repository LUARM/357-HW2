- It is just like running the fw file that was given to us
- We basically just translated our python code from 202 because we worked with hash_quads in one our projects. but still had to add new functionality and functions to meet the requirments of this assigment.
-We were reviewing our data structures in python and made a C version of it and it worked after we where able to add new functions to work with the diffrences in C.
